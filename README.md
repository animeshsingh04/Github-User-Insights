# Github-User-Insights

The project involves using the GitHub API using user authentication to fetch information such as commits and repositories for that specific user and store them as CSV files for data collection and analysis.

To make use of GitHub Api we need to authenticate it, to do so we need OAuth token from GitHub which we can find here - https://github.com/settings/tokens
